# Daily Plan Generator

## Instructions

Follow these steps in order:

1. **Get tasks**: Call the get-tasks tool with only_due_today_or_overdue=true to retrieve ONLY tasks that are due today or overdue. The tool will automatically filter out future tasks and tasks with no due date.
2. **Get calendar events**: Fetch events from my Google Calendar (joel@dotapparel.com.au) for today
3. **Filter calendar events**: EXCLUDE any events that are "out of office" or "focus time" events
4. **Generate Slack message**: Create a message in the format below using only the filtered tasks and events

The Slack message format should be:

---

Morning! ðŸ¤ 
Plans:

- PROJECT NAME
  - PROJECT TASK NAME
- PROJECT NAME
  - PROJECT TASK NAME

Meetings:

- Meeting 1
- Meeting 2
